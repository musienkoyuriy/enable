### VISION


Enabler’s aim is to give developer ability to increase accessibility in development stage, not after publishing site/application to production.
This tool doesn’t have ability to cover ALL accessibility cases due to parsing separate templates but not whole html page.
Enabler is conceived as a universal solution for accessibility problems detection (supporting pure html, angular, vue and react abstractions (react support is not available now. but will be in future)).
